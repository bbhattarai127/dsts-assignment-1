# The first set of images shows the **Predicted vs. Actual Rating** plots for both the **Linear Regression Model 1** and the **Gradient Descent Model 2 (with scaling)**. 
# 
# - In both models, we can observe that as the actual rating increases, the predicted rating also increases, but the **Gradient Descent Model** (right) seems to have more concentrated predictions around certain values, which could indicate the influence of scaling.
# - The **Linear Regression Model** (left) shows more variability in predictions, but the predictions still generally follow the actual ratings trend.
# 
# The **residual plot** in the second image evaluates the performance of the **Linear Regression Model 1**. The residuals represent the difference between the predicted and actual ratings:
# - The residuals increase as the actual rating increases, indicating that the model struggles to accurately predict higher ratings.
# - Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around the red horizontal line (at 0), but in this case, there's a clear pattern, suggesting potential underfitting or model improvement needed.

It reveals that **1,583 samples** were correctly classified as **Class 1** (true positives), while **48 samples** were misclassified as Class 2 (false negatives). For **Class 2**, **278 samples** were correctly classified (true positives), while **191 samples** were misclassified as Class 1 (false positives).

# The three confusion matrices compare the performance of **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers.
# 
# - **Random Forest**: This model correctly classified 1,515 samples in Class 1 and 338 in Class 2, with some misclassifications (116 samples in Class 1 and 131 in Class 2). The overall accuracy is good but slightly lower than the other models.
# - **Accuracy**: 88.24%
# - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN performed better than Random Forest, correctly classifying more samples (1,517 in Class 1 and 361 in Class 2), with fewer misclassifications (114 in Class 1 and 108 in Class 2). This model demonstrates strong classification capabilities.
# - **Accuracy**: 89.48%
# - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: SVM produced the best results, with the fewest misclassifications (101 in Class 1 and 111 in Class 2). It correctly classified 1,530 samples in Class 1 and 358 in Class 2, making it the most accurate classifier in this comparison.
#  - **Accuracy**: 89.90%
# Among these, **SVM** performs the best, followed by **KNN**, and then **Random Forest**.
# 
# 

# #### Question no 9 Answer
# 
# ### Observations:
# 1. **Linear Regression Model 1**:
#    - The predicted vs. actual rating plot shows that predictions generally follow the actual ratings but with high variability, especially for mid-to-high rating classes.
#    - The residual plot indicates increasing residuals as actual ratings increase, suggesting difficulty in accurately predicting higher ratings.
#    - The clear pattern in residuals, rather than random dispersion, indicates potential underfitting, suggesting the model might not fully capture the complexity of the data.
#    - For lower rating classes, the model performs reasonably well, but its performance degrades as the rating increases, indicating a potential bias toward lower ratings.
#    - The residual plot shows a slight skew, suggesting that the model may overpredict ratings for some classes and underpredict for others.
# 
# 2. **Gradient Descent Model 2 (with scaling)**:
#    - Predictions are more concentrated after feature scaling, indicating a tighter fit, but the model still struggles with higher rating predictions.
#    - The concentrated predictions suggest that the model may be influenced by the class distribution after scaling, performing better on lower to mid-range ratings, while higher ratings remain challenging.
#    - Scaling helps in reducing the variability of predictions, but the model still shows a bias towards underestimating higher ratings.
#    - The improvement in prediction for lower ratings suggests that scaling helped distribute the feature space more evenly, but high-rating class distributions may still require further tuning.
# 
# ### Conclusions:
# - Both models face challenges in predicting higher rating classes, as reflected in the increasing residuals and variability of predictions.
# - Scaling improves the performance in the Gradient Descent model but does not fully resolve the difficulty with higher rating classes.
# - The residual patterns indicate that both models may benefit from advanced techniques like regularization, non-linear models, or additional feature engineering to handle class imbalances and improve performance on higher rating predictions.
# - Both models display some bias toward lower ratings, indicating that class imbalance in the data could be affecting performance, particularly for higher-rated restaurants.
# - The modelsâ€™ performance could potentially be enhanced by addressing class distribution more explicitly, either by resampling techniques (oversampling minority classes) or applying weighted loss functions to account for underrepresented classes.
